	abstract = {In this work we propose a stabilized finite element method that permits us to circumvent discrete inf–sup conditions, e.g. allowing equal order interpolation. The type of method we propose belongs to the family of symmetric stabilization techniques, which are based on the introduction of additional terms that penalize the difference between some quantities, i.e. the pressure gradient in the Stokes problem, and their finite element projections. The key feature of the formulation we propose is the definition of the projection to be used, a non-standard Scott–Zhang projector that is well-defined for L 1 ( Ω ) functions. The resulting method has some appealing features: the projector is local and nested meshes or enriched spaces are not required.},

	abstract = {The subject of this book is the efficient solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) that arise when modelling incompressible fluid flow. The material is organized into four groups of two chapters each, covering the Poisson equation (chapters 1 \& 2); the convection-diffucion equation (chapters 3 \& 4); the Stokes equations (chapters 5 \& 6); and the Navier-Stokes equations (chapters 7 \& 8). These equations represent important models within the domain of computational fluid dynamics, but they also arise in many other settings. For each PDE model, there is a chapter concerned with finite element discretization. For each problem and associated solvers there is a description of how to compute along with theoretical analysis which guides the choice of approaches. Illustrative numerical results occur throughout the book, which have been computed with the freely downloadable IFISS software. All numerical results should be reproducible by readers who have access to MATLAB and there is considerable scope for experimentation in the 'computational laboratory' provided by the software. This book provides an excellent introduction to finite elements, iterative linear solvers and scientific computing aimed at graduates in engineering, numerical analysis, applied mathematics and interdisciplinary scientific computing. Including theoretical problems and practical exercises closely tied with freely downloadable MATLAB software, this book is an ideal teaching and learning resource.},

	abstract = {Fluid dynamic turbulence is one of the most challenging computational physics problems because of the extremely wide range of time and space scales involved, the strong nonlinearity of the governing equations, and the many practical and important applications. While most linear fluid instabilities are well understood, the nonlinear interactions among them makes even the relatively simple limit of homogeneous isotropic turbulence difficult to treat physically, mathematically, and computationally. Turbulence is modeled computationally by a two-stage bootstrap process. The first stage, direct numerical simulation, attempts to resolve the relevant physical time and space scales but its application is limited to diffusive flows with a relatively small Reynolds number (Re). Using direct numerical simulation to provide a database, in turn, allows calibration of phenomenological turbulence models for engineering applications. Large eddy simulation incorporates a form of turbulence modeling applicable when the large-scale flows of interest are intrinsically time dependent, thus throwing common statistical models into question. A promising approach to large eddy simulation involves the use of high-resolution monotone computational fluid dynamics algorithms such as flux-corrected transport or the piecewise parabolic method which have intrinsic subgrid turbulence models coupled naturally to the resolved scales in the computed flow. The physical considerations underlying and evidence supporting this monotone integrated large eddy simulation approach are discussed.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a residual-based turbulence model for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The method is derived employing the variational multiscale (VMS) framework. A multiscale decomposition of the continuous solution and a priori unique decomposition of the admissible spaces of functions lead to two coupled nonlinear problems termed as the coarse-scale and the fine-scale sub-problems. The fine-scale velocity field is assumed to be nonlinear and time-dependent and is modeled via the bubble functions approach applied directly to the fine-scale sub-problem. A significant contribution in this paper is a systematic and consistent derivation of the fine-scale variational operator, commonly termed as the stabilization tensor that possesses the right order in the advective and diffusive limits, and variationally projects the fine-scale solution onto the coarse-scale space. A direct treatment of the fine-scale problem via bubble functions offers several fine-scale approximation options with varying degrees of mathematical sophistication that are investigated via benchmark problems. Numerical accuracy of the proposed method is shown on a forced-isotropic turbulence problem, statistically stationary turbulent channel flow problems at ReT = 395 and 590, and non-equilibrium turbulent flow around a cylinder at Re = 3,900.},

Thus, for high-order simulations of underresolved turbulence, proper stabilization is necessary for a successful computation. Two different mechanisms are chosen, and their impact on the accuracy of underresolved high-order computations of turbulent flows is investigated. Results of these approximations for the Taylor-Green Vortex problem are compared to direct numerical simulation results from literature.

The need for stabilization techniques to solve this problem arises because of the restriction in the possible choices for the velocity and pressure spaces dictated by the inf-sup condition, as well as the instabilities encountered when convection is dominant. Both can be overcome by resorting from the standard Galerkin method to a stabilized formulation. The one presented here is based on the subgrid scale concept, in which unresolvable scales of the continuous solution are approximately accounted for. In particular, the approach developed herein is based on the assumption that unresolved subscales are orthogonal to the finite element space. It is shown that this formulation is stable and optimally convergent for an adequate choice of the algorithmic parameters on which the method depends.},

This work describes our first attempt to apply the technique of large-eddy simulation to a flow of aeronautical interest. The challenge for this simulation comes from the high Reynolds number of the flow as well as the variety of flow regimes encountered, including a thin laminar boundary layer at the nose, transition, boundary layer growth under adverse pressure gradient, incipient separation near the trailing edge, and merging of two shear layers at the trailing edge. The flow configuration chosen is a NACA 4412 airfoil near maximum lift. The corresponding angle of attack was determined independently by Wadcock  and Hastings \& Williams  to be close to 12 deg. The simulation matches the chord Reynolds number Uc/v = 1.64 x 10 of Wadcock's experiment.},

It is now widely used in research to elucidate fundamental interactions in physics of turbulence, to predict phe nomena which are closely linked to the unsteady features of turbulence and to create data bases against which statistical closure models can be asses sed. However, its applicability to complex industrial flows, to which statisti cal models are applied routinely, has not been established with any degree of confidence. There is, in particular, a question mark against the prospect of LES becoming an economically tenable alternative to Reynolds-averaged N avier-Stokes methods at practically high Reynolds numbers and in complex geometries. Aerospace flows pose particularly challenging problems to LES, because of the high Reynolds numbers involved, the need to resolve accura tely small-scale features in the thin and often transitional boundary layers developing on aerodynamic surfaces. When the flow also contains a separated region - due to high incidence, say - the range and disparity of the influen tial scales to be resolved is enormous, and this substantially aggravates the problems of resolution and cost. It is just this combination of circumstances that has been at the heart of the project LESFOIL to which this book is devoted. The project combined the efforts, resources and expertise of 9 partner organisations, 4 universities, 3 industrial companies and 2 research institu tes.},

In these cases a more detailed simulation of the turbulence is required. One such detailed simulation technique, large-eddy simulation (LES) has matured to the point of application to complex flows. Historically, these simulations have been carried out with structured grids which suffer from two major difficulties: the extension to higher Reynolds numbers leads to an impractical number of grid points, and most real world flows are rather difficult to represent geometrically with structured grids. Unstructured-grid methods offer a release from both of these constraints. Herein, we describe the development and validation of a massively parallel, stabilized finite element method for LES.},

This coverage provides a pool of implementation hints and considerations that can be very useful for scientists that are willing to tackle large-scale distributed-memory machines using these methods. On the other hand, the paper includes a comprehensive performance and scalability study of the resulting codes when they are applied for the solution of the Poisson problem on a large-scale multicore-based distributed-memory machine with up to 4096 cores. Well-known theoretical results guarantee the optimality (algorithmic scalability) of these preconditioning techniques for weak scaling scenarios, as they are able to keep the condition number of the preconditioned operator bounded by a constant with fixed load per core and increasing number of cores. The experimental study presented in the paper complements this mathematical analysis and answers how far can these methods go in the number of cores and the scale of the problem to still be within reasonable ranges of efficiency on current distributed-memory machines. Besides, for those scenarios where poor scalability is expected, the study precisely identifies, quantifies and justifies which are the main sources of inefficiency.},

	abstract = {According to the Helmholtz decomposition, the irrotational parts of the momentum balance equations of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are balanced by the pressure gradient. Unfortunately, nearly all mixed methods for incompressible flows violate this fundamental property, resulting in the well-known numerical instability of poor mass conservation. The origin of this problem is the lack of L 2 -orthogonality between discretely divergence-free velocities and irrotational vector fields. Therefore, a new variational crime for the nonconforming Crouzeix-Raviart element is proposed, where divergence-free, lowest-order Raviart-Thomas velocity reconstructions reestablish L 2 -orthogonality. This approach allows to construct a cheap flow discretization for general 2d and 3d simplex meshes that possesses the same advantageous robustness properties like divergence-free flow solvers. In the Stokes case, optimal a priori error estimates for the velocity gradients and the pressure are derived. Moreover, the discrete velocity is independent of the continuous pressure. Several detailed linear and nonlinear numerical examples illustrate the theoretical findings.},

These equations represent important models within the domain of computational fluid dynamics, but they also arise in many other settings. For each PDE model, there is a chapter concerned with finite element discretization. For each problem and associated solvers there is a description of how to compute along with theoretical analysis which guides the choice of approaches. Illustrative numerical results occur throughout the book, which have been computed with the freely downloadable IFISS software. All numerical results should be reproducible by readers who have access to MATLAB and there is considerable scope for experimentation in the 'computational laboratory' provided by the software. This book provides an excellent introduction to finite elements, iterative linear solvers and scientific computing aimed at graduates in engineering, numerical analysis, applied mathematics and interdisciplinary scientific computing.

The accuracy of the streamline upwind/Petrov-Galerkin formulation for the linear advection diffusion equation is demonstrated on several numerical examples. The formulation is extended to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. An efficient implicit pressure/explicit velocity transient algorithm is developed which accomodates several treatments of the incompressibility constraint and allows for multiple iterations within a time step.

Three main issues are addressed. The first is a method to estimate the behavior of the stabilization parameters based on a Fourier analysis of the problem for the subscales. Secondly, the way to deal with transient problems discretized using a finite difference scheme is discussed. Finally, the treatment of the nonlinear term is also analyzed. A very important feature of this work is that the subgrid scales are taken as orthogonal to the finite element space. In the transient case, this simplifies considerably the numerical scheme.},

Consistency is achieved in the sense that exact solutions identically satisfy the variational equations. Applied to various problems, simple finite element interpolations are rendered convergent, including convenient equal-order interpolations which are generally unstable within the Galerkin approach.

The methods are subdivided into two classes according to the manner in which stability is attained: 1.

2.
(2) Satisfying Babuška-Brezzi condition methods.


Convergence is established for each class of methods. Applications of the first class of methods to Stokes flow and compressible linear elasticity are presented. The second class of methods is applied to compressible and incompressible elasticity problems.},

While instability in the discrete velocity due to dominant convection and instability in the discrete pressure due to a vanishing discrete Ladyzhenskaya-Babuska-Brezzi (LBB) constant are well-known, instability in the discrete velocity due to a poor mass conservation at high Reynolds numbers sometimes seems to be underestimated. At least, when using conforming Galerkin mixed finite element methods like the Taylor-Hood element, the classical grad-div stabilization for enhancing discrete mass conservation is often neglected in practical computations. Though simple academic flow problems showing the importance of mass conservation are well-known, these examples differ from practically relevant ones, since specially designed force vectors are prescribed. Therefore, we present a simple steady Navier-Stokes problem in two space dimensions at Reynolds number 1024, a colliding flow in a cross-shaped domain, where the instability of poor mass conservation is studied in detail and where no force vector is prescribed.},

	abstract = {Efficient preconditioning for Oseen-type problems is an active research topic. We present a novel approach leveraging stabilization for inf-sup stable discretizations. The Grad-Div stabilization shares the algebraic properties with an augmented Lagrangian-type term. Both simplify the approximation of the Schur complement, especially in the convection-dominated case. We exploit this for the construction of the preconditioner. Solving the discretized Oseen problem with an iterative Krylov-type method shows that the outer iteration numbers are retained independent of mesh size, viscosity, and finite element order. Thus, the preconditioner is very competitive. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

However, even though the analytical rate was only shown to be γ − 1 2 (where γ is the stabilization parameter), the computational results suggest the rate may be improvable to γ − 1 . We prove herein the analytical rate is indeed γ − 1 , and extend the result to other incompressible flow problems including Leray-α and MHD. Numerical results are given that verify the theory.},

	abstract = {In this work we study the performance of some variational multiscale models (VMS) in the large eddy simulation (LES) of turbulent flows. We consider VMS models obtained by different subgrid scale approximations which include either static or dynamic subscales, linear or nonlinear multiscale splitting, and different choices of the subscale space. After a brief review of these models, we discuss some implementation aspects particularly relevant to the simulation of turbulent flows, namely the use of a skew symmetric form of the convective term and the computation of projections when orthogonal subscales are used. We analyze the energy conservation (and numerical dissipation) of the alternative VMS formulations, which is numerically evaluated. In the numerical study, we have considered three well known problems: the decay of homogeneous isotropic turbulence, the Taylor-Green vortex problem and the turbulent flow in a channel. We compare the results obtained using different VMS models, paying special attention to the effect of using orthogonal subscale spaces. The VMS results are also compared against classical LES scheme based on filtering and the dynamic Smagorinsky closure. Altogether, our results show the tremendous potential of VMS for the numerical simulation of turbulence. Further, we study the sensitivity of VMS to the algorithmic constants and analyze the behavior in the small time step limit. We have also carried out a computational cost comparison of the different formulations. Out of these experiments, we can state that the numerical results obtained with the different VMS formulations (as far as they converge) are quite similar. However, some choices are prone to instabilities and the results obtained in terms of computational cost are certainly different. The dynamic orthogonal subscales model turns out to be best in terms of efficiency and robustness.},
