	abstract = {Space-time correlation measurements in the roughly isotropic turbulence behind a regular grid spanning a uniform airstream give the simplest Eulerian time correlation if we choose for the upstream probe signal a time delay which just ‘cancels’ the mean flow displacement. The correlation coefficient of turbulent velocities passed through matched narrow-band niters shows a strong dependence on nominal filter frequency (∼ wave-number at these small turbulence levels). With plausible scaling of the time separations, a scaling dependent on both wave-number and time, it is possible to effect a good collapse of the correlation functions corresponding to wave-numbers from 0·5 cm−1, the location of the peak in the three-dimensional spectrum, to 10 cm−1, about half the Kolmogorov wave-number. The spectrally local time-scaling factor is a ‘parallel’ combination of the times characterizing (i) gross strain distortion by larger eddies, (ii) wrinkling distortion by smaller eddies, (iii) convection by larger eddies and (iv) gross rotation by larger eddies.},

We focus on the second of these. Numerical simulations are performed in a periodic domain whose dimensions, $_{\textrm{box}}$, are much larger than the integral scale of the turbulence, \$l\$. We find that, provided that \$l\_box {\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}g g{\textbackslash}, l\$ and \${\textbackslash}hbox\textit{Re}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}g g{\textbackslash}, 1\$, the turbulence evolves to a state in which \$I\$ is approximately constant and Kolmogorov\&apos;s classical decay law, \$u{\textasciicircum}2{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}sim{\textbackslash}, t{\textasciicircum} - 10 / 7\$, holds true. The approximate conservation of \$I\$ in fully developed turbulence implies that the long-range interactions between remote eddies, as measured by the triple correlations, are very weak.

	abstract = {We propose to perform turbulent flow simulations in such manner that the difference operators do have the same symmetry properties as the underlying differential operators, i.e., the convective operator is represented by a skew-symmetric coefficient matrix and the diffusive operator is approximated by a symmetric, positive-definite matrix. Mimicking crucial properties of differential operators forms in itself a motivation for discretizing them in a certain manner. We give it a concrete form by noting that a symmetry-preserving discretization of the Navier–Stokes equations is stable on any grid, and conserves the total mass, momentum and kinetic energy (for the latter the physical dissipation is to be turned off, of coarse). Being stable on any grid, the choice of the grid may be based on the required accuracy solely, and the main question becomes: how accurate is a symmetry-preserving discretization? Its accuracy is tested for a turbulent flow in a channel by comparing the results to those of physical experiments and previous numerical studies. The comparison is carried out for a Reynolds number of 5600, which is based on the channel width and the mean bulk velocity (based on the channel half-width and wall shear velocity the Reynolds number becomes 180). The comparison shows that with a fourth-order, symmetry-preserving method a 64×64×32 grid suffices to perform an accurate numerical simulation.},

  Abstract                 = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe a variational multiscale finite element approximation for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations using the Boussinesq approximation to model thermal coupling.

Design/methodology/approach - The main feature of the formulation, in contrast to other stabilized methods, is that the subscales are considered as transient and orthogonal to the finite element space. These subscales are solution of a differential equation in time that needs to be integrated. Likewise, the effect of the subscales is kept, both in the nonlinear convective terms of the momentum and temperature equations and, if required, in the thermal coupling term of the momentum equation.

Findings - This strategy allows the approaching of the problem of dealing with thermal turbulence from a strictly numerical point of view and discussion important issues, such as the relationship between the turbulent mechanical dissipation and the turbulent thermal dissipation.

Originality/value - The treatment of thermal turbulence from a strictly numerical point of view is the main originality of the work.},

However, this algorithm suffers from the need to solve in each iteration an inconsistent singular problem for every subdomain, and its convergence deteriorates with increasing number of subdomains due to the lack of a coarse problem to propagate the error globally. We show that the equilibrium conditions for the singular problems on subdomains lead to a simple and natural construction of a coarse problem. The construction is purely algebraic and applies also to systems such as those that arise in elasticity. A convergence bound independent of the number of subdomains is proved and results of computational tests are reported.},

On the other hand, the paper includes a comprehensive performance and scalability study of the resulting codes when they are applied for the solution of the Poisson problem on a large-scale multicore-based distributed-memory machine with up to 4096 cores. Well-known theoretical results guarantee the optimality (algorithmic scalability) of these preconditioning techniques for weak scaling scenarios, as they are able to keep the condition number of the preconditioned operator bounded by a constant with xed load per core and increasing number of cores. The experimental study presented in the paper complements this mathematical analysis and answers how far can these methods go in the number of cores and the scale of the problem to still be within reasonable ranges of eciency on current distributed-memory machines. Besides, for those scenarios where poor scalability is expected, the study precisely identies, quanties and justies which are the main sources of inefficiency.},

The progress in weighted graph matching algorithms helps to extend these concepts further and unsymmetric prepermutation of rows is used to place large matrix entries on the diagonal. Complete block diagonal supernode pivoting allows dynamical interchanges of columns and rows during the factorization process. The level-3 BLAS efficiency is retained and an advanced two-level left-right looking scheduling scheme results in good speedup on SMP machines. These algorithms have been integrated into the recent unsymmetric version of the PARDISO solver. Experiments demonstrate that a wide set of unsymmetric linear systems can be solved and high performance is consistently achieved for large sparse unsymmetric matrices from real world applications.},

The proposed algorithms do not require the construction of a coarse mesh and avoid expensive communications between coarse and fine levels. The algorithms belong to the family of preconditioners based on non-overlapping decomposition of subregions known as balancing domain decomposition methods. The local problems employ two-level element-wise/subdomain-wise direct factorizations to reduce the size and the cost of the local Dirichlet and Neumann Stokes solvers. The Stokes coarse problem is based on subdomain constant pressures and on connected subdomain interface flux functions and rigid body motions. This guarantees scalability and solvability of the local Neumann problems. Estimates on the condition numbers and numerical experiments based on a parallel implementation for unstructured meshes are also discussed.},

Balancing Neumann-Neumann methods are extented to mixed formulations of the linear elasticity system with discontinuous coefficients, discretized with mixed finite or spectral elements with discontinuous pressures. These domain decomposition methods implicitly eliminate the degrees of freedom associated with the interior of each subdomain and solve iteratively the resulting saddle point Schur complement using a hybrid preconditioner based on a coarse mixed elasticity problem and local mixed elasticity problems with natural and essential boundary conditions. A polylogarithmic bound in the local number of degrees of freedom is proven for the condition number of the preconditioned operator in the constant coefficient case. Parallel and serial numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results, indicate that they still hold for systems with discontinuous coefficients, and show that our algorithm is scalable, parallel, and robust with respect to material heterogeneities. The results on heterogeneous general problems are also supported in part by our theory.},

  Abstract                 = {The {FETI} algorithms are a family of numerically scalable domain decomposition methods. They have been designed in the early 1990s for solving iteratively and on parallel machines, large-scale systems of equations arising from the finite element discretization of solid mechanics, structural engineering, structural dynamics, and acoustic scattering problems, and for analyzing complex structures obtained from the assembly of substructures with incompatible discrete interfaces. In this paper, we present the second generation of these methods that operate more efficiently on large numbers of subdomains, offer greater robustness, better performance, and more flexibility for implementation on a wider variety of computational platforms. We also report on the application and performance of these methods for the solution of geometrically non-linear structural analysis problems. We discuss key aspects of their implementation on shared and distributed memory parallel processors, benchmark them against optimized direct sparse solvers, and highlight their potential with the solution of large-scale structural mechanics problems with several million degrees of freedom.},

  Abstract                 = {A novel domain decomposition approach for the parallel finite element solution of equilibrium equations is presented. The spatial domain is partitioned into a set of totally disconnected subdomains, each assigned to an individual processor. Lagrange multipliers are introduced to enforce compatibility at the interface nodes. In the static case, each floating subdomain induces a local singularity that is resolved in two phases. First, the rigid body modes are eliminated in parallel from each local problem and a direct scheme is applied concurrently to all subdomains in order to recover each partial local solution. Next, the contributions of these modes are related to the Lagrange multipliers through an orthogonality condition. A parallel conjugate projected gradient algorithm is developed for the solution of the coupled system of local rigid modes components and Lagrange multipliers, which completes the solution of the problem. When implemented on local memory multiprocessors, this proposed method of tearing and interconnecting requires less interprocessor communications than the classical method of substructuring. It is also suitable for parallel/vector computers with shared memory. Moreover, unlike parallel direct solvers, it exhibits a degree of parallelism that is not limited by the bandwidth of the finite element system of equations.},

  Abstract                 = {The ability to simulate complex unsteady flows is limited by the current state of the art of subgrid-scale (SGS) modeling, which invariably relies on the use of Smagorinsky-type isotropic eddy-viscosity models. Turbulent flows of practical importance involve inherently three-dimensional unsteady features, often subjected to strong inhomogeneous effects and rapid deformation, which cannot be captured by isotropic models. Although some available improved \{SGS\} models can outperform the isotropic eddy-viscosity models, their practical use is typically limited because of their complexity. Development of more-sophisticated \{SGS\} models is actively pursued, and it is desirable to also investigate alternative nonconventional approaches. In ordinary large eddy simulation (LES) approaches models are introduced for closure of the low-pass filtered Navier-Stokes equations (NSE). A promising \{LES\} approach is the monotonically integrated \{LES\} (MILES), which involves solving the unfiltered \{NSE\} using high-resolution monotone algorithms; in this approach, implicit \{SGS\} models, provided by intrinsic nonlinear high-frequency filters built into the convection discretization, are coupled naturally to the resolvable scales of the flow. Formal properties of the effective \{SGS\} modeling using \{MILES\} are documented using databases of simulated free and wall-bounded inhomogeneous flows, including isotropic decaying turbulence, transitional jets, and channel flows. Mathematical and physical aspects of (implicit) \{SGS\} modeling through the use of nonlinear flux limiters are addressed using a formalism based on the modified \{LES\} equations. },

  Abstract                 = {In this work we propose a variational multiscale finite element approximation of thermally coupled
low speed flows. The physical model is described by the low Mach number equations, which
are obtained as a limit of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations in the small Mach number
regime. In contrast to the commonly used Boussinesq approximation, this model permits to take
volumetric deformation into account. Although the former is more general than the later, both systems
have similar mathematical structure and their numerical approximation can suffer from the
same type of instabilities.
We propose a stabilized finite element approximation based on the the variational multiscale
method, in which a decomposition of the approximating space into a coarse scale resolvable part
and a fine scale subgrid part is performed. Modeling the subscale and taking its effect on the coarse
scale problem into account results in a stable formulation. The quality of the final approximation
(accuracy, efficiency) depends on the particular model.
The distinctive features of our approach are to consider the subscales as transient and to keep
the scale splitting in all the nonlinear terms. The first ingredient permits to obtain an improved time
discretization scheme (higher accuracy, better stability, no restrictions on the time step size). The
second ingredient permits to prove global conservation properties. It also allows us to approach the
problem of dealing with thermal turbulence from a strictly numerical point of view.
Numerical tests show that nonlinear and dynamic subscales give more accurate solutions than
classical stabilized methods.},

  Abstract                 = {The concept of isogeometric analysis is proposed. Basis functions generated from NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines) are employed to construct an exact geometric model. For purposes of analysis, the basis is refined and/or its order elevated without changing the geometry or its parameterization. Analogues of finite element h- and p-refinement schemes are presented and a new, more efficient, higher-order concept, k-refinement, is introduced. Refinements are easily implemented and exact geometry is maintained at all levels without the necessity of subsequent communication with a CAD (Computer Aided Design) description. In the context of structural mechanics, it is established that the basis functions are complete with respect to affine transformations, meaning that all rigid body motions and constant strain states are exactly represented. Standard patch tests are likewise satisfied. Numerical examples exhibit optimal rates of convergence for linear elasticity problems and convergence to thin elastic shell solutions. A k-refinement strategy is shown to converge toward monotone solutions for advection-diffusion processes with sharp internal and boundary layers, a very surprising result. It is argued that isogeometric analysis is a viable alternative to standard, polynomial-based, finite element analysis and possesses several advantages.},

In the case of the {FV-MLS} method, we take advantage of the multiresolution properties of Moving Least Squares Approximations, and we show that they can be used as an implicit {SGS} model. The numerical results are encouraging. The third-order {FV-MLS} method is able to reproduce the inertial subrange, and it obtains better results than other usual numerical schemes in {LES} computations, such as the {MUSCL} scheme.

  Abstract                 = {Summation-by-parts ({SBP)} operators have a number of properties that make them an attractive option for higher-order spatial discretizations of partial differential equations. In particular, they enable the derivation of higher-order boundary closures leading to provable time stability. When implemented on multi-block structured meshes in conjunction with simultaneous approximation terms ({SATs)—penalty} terms that impose boundary and interblock-coupling conditions in a weak sense—they offer additional properties of value, even for second-order accurate schemes and steady problems. For example, they involve low communication overhead for efficient parallel algorithms and relax the continuity requirements of both the mesh and the solution across block interfaces. This paper provides a brief history of seminal contributions to, and applications of, {SBP-SAT} methods followed by a description of their properties and a methodology for deriving {SBP} operators for first derivatives and second derivatives with variable coefficients. A procedure for deriving {SATs} is also provided. Practical aspects are discussed, including artificial dissipation, transformation to curvilinear coordinates, and application to the {Navier–Stokes} equations. Recent developments are reviewed, including a variational interpretation, the connection to quadrature rules, functional superconvergence, error estimates, and dual consistency.

  Abstract                 = {High-order finite difference methods are efficient, easy to program, scale well in multiple dimensions and can be modified locally for various reasons (such as shock treatment for example). The main drawback has been the complicated and sometimes even mysterious stability treatment at boundaries and interfaces required for a stable scheme. The research on summation-by-parts operators and weak boundary conditions during the last 20 years has removed this drawback and now reached a mature state. It is now possible to construct stable and high order accurate multi-block finite difference schemes in a systematic building-block-like manner. In this paper we will review this development, point out the main contributions and speculate about the next lines of research in this area.},

The same principles followed by Verstappen and Veldman (2003) [3] are generalized for unstructured meshes. Here, a collocated-mesh scheme is preferred over a staggered one due to its simpler form for such meshes. The basic idea behind this approach remains the same: mimicking the crucial symmetry properties of the underlying differential operators, i.e., the convective operator is approximated by a skew-symmetric matrix and the diffusive operator by a symmetric, positive-definite matrix. A novel approach to eliminate the checkerboard spurious modes without introducing any non-physical dissipation is proposed. To do so, a fully-conservative regularization of the convective term is used. The supraconvergence of the method is numerically showed and the treatment of boundary conditions is discussed. Finally, the new discretization method is successfully tested for a buoyancy-driven turbulent flow in a differentially heated cavity.},

Mimicking crucial properties of differential operators forms in itself a motivation for discretizing them in a certain manner. We give it a concrete form by noting that a symmetry-preserving discretization of the {Navier–Stokes} equations is stable on any grid, and conserves the total mass, momentum and kinetic energy (for the latter the physical dissipation is to be turned off, of coarse). Being stable on any grid, the choice of the grid may be based on the required accuracy solely, and the main question becomes: how accurate is a symmetry-preserving discretization? Its accuracy is tested for a turbulent flow in a channel by comparing the results to those of physical experiments and previous numerical studies. The comparison is carried out for a Reynolds number of 5600, which is based on the channel width and the mean bulk velocity (based on the channel half-width and wall shear velocity the Reynolds number becomes 180). The comparison shows that with a fourth-order, symmetry-preserving method a 64×64×32 grid suffices to perform an accurate numerical simulation.},

A novel adaptive algorithm for splitting the system into implicit and explicit sets is developed. The method is validated using several canonical laminar and turbulent flows. Load balance for the new scheme is achieved by a dual-constraint, domain decomposition algorithm. The scalability and computational efficiency of the method is investigated, and memory savings compared with a fully implicit method is demonstrated. A notable reduction of computational costs compared to both fully implicit and fully explicit schemes is observed.},

  Abstract                 = {The adaptive local deconvolution method ({ALDM)} is proposed as a new nonlinear discretization scheme designed for implicit large-eddy simulation ({ILES)} of turbulent flows. In {ILES} the truncation error of the discretization of the convective terms functions as a subgrid-scale model. Therefore, the model is implicitly contained within the discretization, and an explicit computation of model terms becomes unnecessary. The discretization is based on a solution-adaptive deconvolution operator which allows to control the truncation error. Deconvolution parameters are determined by an analysis of the spectral numerical viscosity. An automatic optimization based on an evolutionary algorithm is employed to obtain a set of parameters which results in an optimum spectral match for the numerical viscosity with theoretical predictions for isotropic turbulence. Simulations of large-scale forced and decaying three-dimensional homogeneous isotropic turbulence show an excellent agreement with theory and experimental data and demonstrate the good performance of the implicit model. As an example for transitional flows, instability and breakdown of the three-dimensional {Taylor–Green} vortex are considered. The implicit model correctly predicts instability growth and transition to developed turbulence. It is shown that the implicit model performs at least as well as established explicit models.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we investigate the accuracy of a high-order discontinuous {Galerkin} discretization for the coarse resolution simulation of turbulent flow. We show that a low-order approximation exhibits unacceptable numerical discretization errors, whereas a naive application of high-order discretizations in those situations is often unstable due to aliasing. Thus, for high-order simulations of underresolved turbulence, proper stabilization is necessary for a successful computation. Two different mechanisms are chosen, and their impact on the accuracy of underresolved high-order computations of turbulent flows is investigated. Results of these approximations for the {Taylor-Green} Vortex problem are compared to direct numerical simulation results from literature. Our findings show that the superior discretization properties of high-order approximations are retained even for these coarsely resolved computations.},

  Abstract                 = {Energy-conserving methods have recently gained popularity for the spatial discretization of the incompressible {Navier-Stokes} equations. In this paper implicit {Runge-Kutta} methods are investigated which keep this property when integrating in time. Firstly, a number of energy-conserving {Runge-Kutta} methods based on Gauss, Radau and Lobatto quadrature are constructed. These methods are suitable for convection-dominated problems (such as turbulent flows), because they do not introduce artificial diffusion and are stable for any time step. Secondly, to obtain robust time-integration methods that work also for stiff problems, the energy-conserving methods are extended to a new class of additive {Runge-Kutta} methods, which combine energy conservation with L-stability. In this class, the Radau {IIA/B} method has the best properties. Results for a number of test cases on two-stage methods indicate that for pure convection problems the additive Radau {IIA/B} method is competitive with the Gauss methods. However, for stiff problems, such as convection-dominated flows with thin boundary layers, both the higher order Gauss and Radau {IIA/B} method suffer from order reduction. Overall, the Gauss methods are the preferred method for energy-conserving time integration of the incompressible {Navier-Stokes} equations.},

The key feature of the formulation we propose is the definition of the projection to be used, a non-standard {Scott-Zhang} projector that is well-defined for L 1 ( Ω ) functions. The resulting method has some appealing features: the projector is local and nested meshes or enriched spaces are not required.},

  Abstract                 = {In this article, we propose different splitting procedures for the transient incompressible magnetohydrodynamics ({MHD)} system that are unconditionally stable. We consider two levels of splitting, on one side we perform the segregation of the fluid pressure and magnetic pseudo-pressure from the vectorial fields computation. At the second level, the fluid velocity and induction fields are also decoupled. This way, we transform a fully coupled indefinite multi-physics system into a set of smaller definite ones, clearly reducing the {CPU} cost. With regard to the finite element approximation, we stick to an unconditionally convergent stabilized finite element formulation because it introduces convection stabilization, allows to circumvent inf-sup conditions (clearly simplifying implementation issues), and is able to capture non-smooth solutions of the magnetic subproblem. However, residual-based finite element formulations are not suitable for segregation, because they lose the skew-symmetry of the off-diagonal blocks. Therefore, in this work, we have proposed a novel term-by-term stabilization of the {MHD} system based on projections that is still unconditionally convergent.

It is shown that, at least up to and including fourth order, the velocity attains the classical order of accuracy without further constraints. However, in case of a time-dependent gradient operator, which can appear in case of time-varying meshes, additional order conditions need to be satisfied to ensure the correct order of accuracy. Furthermore, the pressure is only first-order accurate unless additional order conditions are satisfied. Two new methods that lead to a second-order accurate pressure are proposed, which are applicable to a certain class of three- and four-stage methods. A special case appears when the boundary conditions for the continuity equation are independent of time, since in that case the pressure can be computed to the same accuracy as the velocity field, without additional cost. Relevant computations of decaying vortices and of an actuator disk in a time-dependent inflow support the analysis and the proposed methods.},

  Abstract                 = {In this work, we present a stabilized formulation to solve the inductionless magnetohydrodynamic ({MHD)} problem using the finite element ({FE)} method. The {MHD} problem couples the {Navier-Stokes} equations and a Darcy-type system for the electric potential via Lorentz’s force in the momentum equation of the {Navier-Stokes} equations and the currents generated by the moving fluid in Ohm’s law. The key feature of the {FE} formulation resides in the design of the stabilization terms, which serve several purposes. First, the formulation is suitable for convection dominated flows. Second, there is no need to use interpolation spaces constrained to a compatibility condition in both sub-problems and therefore, equal-order interpolation spaces can be used for all the unknowns. Finally, this formulation leads to a coupled linear system; this monolithic approach is effective, since the coupling can be dealt by effective preconditioning and iterative solvers that allows to deal with high Hartmann numbers.},

Uniform stability of the general formulation is proved under a regularity condition on data, or a moderate inverse {CFL-condition} that allows for optimal choices of the discretization parameters. Both the backward Euler method ({BDF1)}, the {Crank-Nicolson} scheme and the second-order backward differentiation formula ({BDF2)} enter the framework and quasi-optimal convergence is proved for these schemes.},

The residual-based variational multiscale method with time-dependent (dynamic) subgrid scales is presented, and the impact of the time dependency is studied for the well-known test case of turbulent channel flow. Results are presented from computations for various values of the Reynolds number, namely Re τ = 180 , Re τ = 395 and Re τ = 590 , and several time-step sizes. A generalized- α time-integration scheme is employed. Results from our numerical experiments with dynamic subgrid scales are compared to results obtained with an approximation not explicitly taking the time-dependency of the subgrid scales into account. For all Re τ values and time-step sizes under consideration, results for resolved quantities computed by both approaches are very similar. This statement applies to both, mean streamwise velocity and root-mean-square velocity fluctuations.

This paper presents a systematic study of three classes of implicit and linearly implicit time stepping schemes with adaptive time step control applied to a {2D} laminar flow around a cylinder: θ -schemes, diagonal-implicit {Runge-Kutta} ({DIRK)} methods and {Rosenbrock-Wanner} ({ROW)} methods. The time step is controlled using embedded methods. It is shown that several {ROW} methods clearly outperform the more standard θ -schemes and the {DIRK} methods. The results depend on a prescribed tolerance in the time step control algorithm, whose appropriate choice varies from scheme to scheme.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper examines the role of continuity of the basis in the computation of turbulent flows. We compare standard finite elements and non-uniform rational B-splines ({NURBS)} discretizations that are employed in Isogeometric Analysis (Hughes et al. in Comput Methods Appl Mech Eng, 194:4135-4195, 2005). We make use of quadratic discretizations that are C 0 -continuous across element boundaries in standard finite elements, and C 1 -continuous in the case of {NURBS.} The variational multiscale residual-based method (Bazilevs in Isogeometric analysis of turbulence and fluid-structure interaction, {PhD} thesis, {ICES}, {UT} Austin, 2006; Bazilevs et al. in Comput Methods Appl Mech Eng, submitted, 2007; Calo in Residual-based multiscale turbulence modeling: finite volume simulation of bypass transition. {PhD} thesis, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Stanford University, 2004; Hughes et al. in proceedings of the {XXI} international congress of theoretical and applied mechanics ({IUTAM)}, Kluwer, 2004; Scovazzi in Multiscale methods in science and engineering, {PhD} thesis, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Stanford Universty, 2004) is employed as a turbulence modeling technique. We find that C 1 -continuous discretizations outperform their C 0 -continuous counterparts on a per-degree-of-freedom basis. We also find that the effect of continuity is greater for higher Reynolds number flows.},

  Abstract                 = {This work is an overview of algebraic pressure segregation methods for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. These methods can be understood as an {inexactLU} block factorization of the original system matrix. We have considered a wide set of methods: algebraic pressure correction methods, algebraic velocity correction methods and the Yosida method. Higher order schemes, based on improved factorizations, are also introduced. We have also explained the relationship between these pressure segregation methods and some widely used preconditioners, and we have introduced predictor-corrector methods, one-loop algorithms where nonlinearity and iterations towards the monolithic system are coupled.},

In the calculations, we employed linear, quadratic and cubic {NURBS.} A dispersion analysis of simple model problems revealed {NURBS} elements to be superior to classical finite elements in approximating advective and diffusive processes, which play a significant role in turbulence computations.

  Abstract                 = {A conservative formulation of the Lorentz force is given here for magnetohydrodynamic ({MHD)} flows at a low magnetic Reynolds number with the current density calculated based on Ohm’s law and the electrical potential formula. This conservative formula shows that the total momentum contributed from the Lorentz force is conservative when the applied magnetic field is constant. For the case with a non-constant applied magnetic field, the Lorentz force has been divided into two parts: a strong globally conservative part and a weak locally conservative part. The conservative formula has been employed to develop a conservative scheme for the calculation of the Lorentz force on an unstructured collocated mesh. Only the current density fluxes on the cell faces, which are calculated using a consistent scheme with good conservation, are needed for the calculation of the Lorentz force. Meanwhile, a conservative interpolation technique is designed to get the current density at the cell center from the current density fluxes on the cell faces. This conservative interpolation can keep the current density at the cell center conservative, which can be used to calculate the Lorentz force at the cell center with good accuracy. The Lorentz force calculated from the conservative current at the cell center is equivalent to the Lorentz force from the conservative formula when the applied magnetic field is constant, which can conserve the total momentum. We will further prove that the simple interpolation scheme used in the Part I [M.-J. Ni, R. Munipalli, {N.B.} Morley, {P.Y.} Huang, M.

In this collocated grid, velocity (u), pressure (p), and electrical potential (φ) are located in the grid center, while current fluxes are located on the cell faces. The calculation of current fluxes on the cell faces is conducted using a conservative scheme, which is consistent with the discretization scheme for the solution of electrical potential Poisson equation. A conservative interpolation is used to get the current density at the cell center, which is used to conduct the calculation of Lorentz force at the cell center for momentum equations. We will show that both “conservative” and “consistent” are important properties of the scheme to get an accurate result for high Hartmann number {MHD} flows with a strongly non-uniform mesh employed to resolve the Hartmann layers and side layers of Hunt’s conductive walls and Shercliff’s insulated walls. A general second-order projection method has been developed for the incompressible {Navier-Stokes} equations with the Lorentz force included. This projection method can accurately balance the pressure term and the Lorentz force for a fully developed core flow. This method can also simplify the pressure boundary conditions for {MHD} flows.},

The higher order of accuracy as compared to the existing semi-implicit {Runge-Kutta} schemes is achieved due to one additional inversion of the implicit operator I-{τγL}, which requires inversion of tridiagonal matrices when using approximate factorization method. No additional solution of the pressure-Poisson equation or evaluation of {Navier-Stokes} operator is needed. The scheme is supplied with a local error estimation and time-step control algorithm. The temporal third-order accuracy of the scheme is proved analytically and ascertained by analysing both local and global errors in a numerical example. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Three main issues are addressed. The first is a method to estimate the behavior of the stabilization parameters based on a Fourier analysis of the problem for the subscales. Secondly, the way to deal with transient problems discretized using a finite difference scheme is discussed. Finally, the treatment of the nonlinear term is also analyzed. A very important feature of this work is that the subgrid scales are taken as orthogonal to the finite element space. In the transient case, this simplifies considerably the numerical scheme.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a variant of the classical weighted least-squares stabilization for the {Stokes} equations. Compared to the original formulation, the new method has improved accuracy properties, especially near boundaries. Furthermore, no modification of the right-hand side is needed, and implementation is simplified, especially for generalizations to more complicated equations. The approach is based on local projections of the residual terms which are used in order to achieve consistency of the method, avoiding local evaluation of the strong form of the differential operator. We prove stability and give a priori and a posteriori error estimates. We show convergence of an iterative method which uses a simplified stabilized discretization as preconditioner. Numerical experiments indicate that the approach presented is at least as accurate as the original method, but offers some algorithmic advantages. The ideas presented here also apply to the {Navier--{Stokes}} equations. This is the topic of forthcoming work.},

The first of them is the stabilization through the pressure gradient projection, which consists of adding a certain least-squares form of the difference between the pressure gradient and its L2 projection onto the discrete velocity space in the variational equations of the problem. The second is a sub-grid scale method, whose stabilization effect is very similar to that of the Galerkin/least-squares ({GLS)} method for the Stokes problem. It is shown here that the first method can also be recast in the framework of sub-grid scale methods with a particular choice for the space of sub-scales. This leads to a new stabilization procedure, whose applicability to stabilize convection is also studied in this paper.},

An expression for this matrix is proposed for the case of general coupled systems of equations that is an extension of the expression proposed for a one-dimensional ({1D)} model problem. Applications of the stabilization technique to the Stokes problem with convection and to the bending of {Reissner-Mindlin} plates are discussed next. The design of the matrix of stabilization parameters is based on the identification of the stability deficiencies of the standard Galerkin method applied to these two problems.},

We show how the exact theory represents a paradigm for subgrid-scale models and a posteriori error estimation. We examine hierarchical p-methods and bubbles in order to understand and, ultimately, approximate the ‘fine-scale Green's function’ which appears in the theory. We review relationships between residual-free bubbles, element Green's functions and stabilized methods. These suggest the applicability of the methodology to physically interesting problems in fluid mechanics, acoustics and electromagnetics.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we study a variational formulation of the Stokes problem that accommodates the use of equal velocity-pressure finite element interpolations. The motivation of this method relies on the analysis of a class of fractional-step methods for the Navier-Stokes equations for which it is known that equal interpolations yield good numerical results. The reason for this turns out to be the difference between two discrete Laplacian operators computed in a different manner. The formulation of the Stokes problem considered here aims to reproduce this effect. From the analysis of the finite element approximation of the problem we obtain stability and optimal error estimates using velocity-pressure interpolations satisfying a compatibility condition much weaker than the inf-sup condition of the standard formulation. In particular, this condition is fulfilled by the most common equal order interpolations.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper reports on direct and large-eddy simulations ({LES)} of turbulent flows using the lattice-Boltzmann scheme for the discretization of the Navier-Stokes equations. It is divided into two parts. The first part deals with direct simulation of fully developed turbulent channel flow with heat transfer in order to check the performance of our solver. It is shown that the present numerical results agree well with the numerical results reported by Kim et al. (1987). The second part deals with large-eddy simulation ({LES)} of the turbulent flow in a baffled stirred tank reactor. This kind of equipment is frequently used in the (petro)chemical industry for mixing applications and is, therefore, of direct practical relevance. Large-eddy simulation is a powerful tool to study such flows, as it accounts in a natural way for the unsteady and quasi-periodic behavior of these flows. The results of our first attempt to simulate this flow by means of modeling the impact of the mechanical impeller on the flow field via a varying force field in space and time, reveal a fair agreement with available experimental data. In accordance with measurements, it is shown that the thickness of the impeller blades plays an important role for the motion of the fluid in the vicinity of the impeller. In conclusion, the present application of {LES} to this engineering flow problem clearly shows the potential of {LES} as a tool to investigate turbulent flows in industrial applications of practical importance.},

  Abstract                 = {The subject of this book is the solution of stiff differential equations and of differential-algebraic systems (differential equations with constraints). The book is divided into four chapters. The beginning of each chapter is of introductory nature, followed by practical applications, the discussion of numerical results, theoretical investigations on the order and accuracy, linear and nonlinear stability, convergence and asymptotic expansions. Stiff and differential-algebraic problems arise everywhere in scientific computations (e.g., in physics, chemistry, biology, control engineering, electrical network analysis, mechanical systems). Many applications as well as computer programs are presented.},

  Abstract                 = {The {Neumann-Neumann} algorithm is known to be an efficient domain decomposition preconditioner with unstructured subdomains for iterative solution of finite-element discretizations of difficult problems with strongly discontinuous coefficients (De Roeck and Le Tallec, 1991). However, this algorithm suffers from the need to solve in each iteration an inconsistent singular problem for every subdomain, and its convergence deteriorates with increasing number of subdomains due to the lack of a coarse problem to propagate the error globally. We show that the equilibrium conditions for the singular problems on subdomains lead to a simple and natural construction of a coarse problem. The construction is purely algebraic and applies also to systems such as those that arise in elasticity. A convergence bound independent of the number of subdomains is proved and results of computational tests are reported.},

Using a spectral method taking advantage of the symmetries of the flow, a resolution of 8643 and corresponding high Reynolds numbers (Rλ = 140) are obtained Visualisations of the resulting turbulent flow show that the turbulent activity is strongly correlated with low-pressure zones. We demonstrate that this behavior of the pressure field is linked to the fact that the square vorticity is spatially more concentrated than the energy dissipation.},

The method is based on a fractional-step, or time-splitting, scheme in conjunction with the approximate-factorization technique. It is shown that the use of velocity boundary conditions for the intermediate velocity field can lead to inconsistent numerical solutions. Appropriate boundary conditions for the intermediate velocity field are derived and tested. Numerical solutions for flows inside a driven cavity and over a backward-facing step are presented and compared with experimental data and other numerical results.},

There is a significant computational advantage in diagonally implicit formulae, whose coefficient matrix is lower triangular with all diagonal elements equal. We derive new, strongly S-stable diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta formulae of order 2 in 2 stages and of order 3 in 3 stages, and show that it is impossible for a strongly S-stable diagonally implicit method to attain order 4 in 4 stages. Merely A-stable diagonally implicit formulae, of order 3 in 2 stages and of order 4 in 3 stages, were previously known; we prove that no 4-stage method of this type has order 5. We describe a computer program for stiff differential equations which uses these methods, and compare them to each other and to the {GEAR} package.},
