	abstract = {The subject of turbulence, the most forbidding in fluid dynamics, has usually proved treacherous to the beginner, caught in the whirls and eddies of its nonlinearities and statistical imponderables. This is the first book specifically designed to offer the student a smooth transitionary course between elementary fluid dynamics (which gives only last-minute attention to turbulence) and the professional literature on turbulent flow, where an advanced viewpoint is assumed.  Moreover, the text has been developed for students, engineers, and scientists with different technical backgrounds and interests. Almost all flows, natural and man-made, are turbulent. Thus the subject is the concern of geophysical and environmental scientists (in dealing with atmospheric jet streams, ocean currents, and the flow of rivers, for example), of astrophysicists (in studying the photospheres of the sun and stars or mapping gaseous nebulae), and of engineers (in calculating pipe flows, jets, or wakes). Many such examples are discussed in the book.  The approach taken avoids the difficulties of advanced mathematical development on the one side and the morass of experimental detail and empirical data on the other. As a result of following its midstream course, the text gives the student a physical understanding of the subject and deepens his intuitive insight into those problems that cannot now be rigorously solved.  In particular, dimensional analysis is used extensively in dealing with those problems whose exact solution is mathematically elusive. Dimensional reasoning, scale arguments, and similarity rules are introduced at the beginning and are applied throughout. A discussion of Reynolds stress and the kinetic theory of gases provides the contrast needed to put mixing-length theory into proper perspective: the authors present a thorough comparison between the mixing-length models and dimensional analysis of shear flows. This is followed by an extensive treatment of vorticity dynamics, including vortex stretching and vorticity budgets.  Two chapters are devoted to boundary-free shear flows and well-bounded turbulent shear flows. The examples presented include wakes, jets, shear layers, thermal plumes, atmospheric boundary layers, pipe and channel flow, and boundary layers in pressure gradients.  The spatial structure of turbulent flow has been the subject of analysis in the book up to this point, at which a compact but thorough introduction to statistical methods is given. This prepares the reader to understand the stochastic and spectral structure of turbulence. The remainder of the book consists of applications of the statistical approach to the study of turbulent transport (including diffusion and mixing) and turbulent spectra.},

	shorttitle = {Turbulence in {Fluids}},
	abstract = {Turbulence is a dangerous topic which is often at the origin of serious fights in the scientific meetings devoted to it since it represents extremely different points of view, all of which have in common their complexity, as well as an inability to solve the problem. It is even difficult to agree on what exactly is the problem to be solved. Extremely schematically, two opposing points of view have been advocated during these last ten years: the first one is "statistical", and tries to model the evolution of averaged quantities of the flow. This com has followed the glorious trail of Taylor and Kolmogorov, munity, which believes in the phenomenology of cascades, and strongly disputes the possibility of any coherence or order associated to turbulence. On the other bank of the river stands the "coherence among chaos" community, which considers turbulence from a purely deterministic po int of view, by studying either the behaviour of dynamical systems, or the stability of flows in various situations. To this community are also associated the experimentalists who seek to identify coherent structures in shear flows.},

	abstract = {Based on a taught by the author at the University of Cambridge, this comprehensive text on turbulence and fluid dynamics is aimed at year 4 undergraduates and graduates in applied mathematics, physics, and engineering, and provides an ideal reference for industry professionals and researchers. It bridges the gap between elementary accounts of turbulence found in undergraduate texts and more rigorous accounts given in monographs on the subject. Containing many examples, the author combines the maximum of physical insight with the minimum of mathematical detail where possible. The text is highly illustrated throughout, and includes colour plates; required mathematical techniques are covered in extensive appendices. The text is divided into three parts: Part I consists of a traditional introduction to the classical aspects of turbulence, the nature of turbulence, and the equations of fluid mechanics. Mathematics is kept to a minimum, presupposing only an elementary knowledge of fluid mechanics and statistics. Part II tackles the problem of homogeneous turbulence with a focus on describing the phenomena in real space. Part III covers certain special topics rarely discussed in introductory texts. Many geophysical and astrophysical flows are dominated by the effects of body forces, such as buoyancy, Coriolis and Lorentz forces. Moreover, certain large-scale flows are approximately two-dimensional and this has led to a concerted investigation of two-dimensional turbulence over the last few years. Both the influence of body forces and two-dimensional turbulence are discussed.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.cma.2012.09.015},
	abstract = {This paper presents three-level residual-based turbulence models for the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. Employing the variational multiscale (VMS) framework, the velocity and pressure fields are decomposed into two overlapping hierarchical scales, thereby leading to a system of coupled mixed field problems. The mixed problem at the fine scales is stabilized via a subsequent VMS application that results in a further decomposition of the fine-scale velocity field into level-I and level-II scales. The level-II scales are modeled using higher-order bubble functions that are then variationally embedded in the level-I formulation to stabilize it. The level-I problem is modeled via a second set of bubble functions that are linearly independent of the bubbles employed at level-II. Finally, the resulting level-I fine-scales are variationally embedded in the coarse-scale formulation. This yields a residual-based turbulence model for the larger or coarser-scales. A significant feature of the proposed method is that it results in a concurrent top-down and bottom up two-way nesting of the scales. In addition, the resulting turbulence model does not possess any embedded tunable parameters. Another attribute of the formulation is that the fine scales at every level are driven by the residuals of the Euler–Lagrange equations of the coarser scales at the preceding levels, thereby resulting in a method that is variationally consistent. Various algorithmic generalizations of the method are presented that lead to computationally economic residual-based turbulence models. The proposed telescopic depth in scales approach helps make these models accurate for low order tetrahedral and hexahedral elements, a feature that is facilitated by the higher-order bubble functions over element interiors and it results in an enhanced representation of the fine-scale terms modeling the fine viscous effects. From a computational perspective this method results in easy-to-implement equal-order pressure–velocity elements, and possesses the desirable p-refinement feature. Numerical performance of the method is assessed on turbulent channel flow problems at Re = 395 and Re = 590 . Also presented are the results for turbulent SD-7003 airfoil at Re = 60 , 000 and comparison is made with the published experimental data and numerical results.},

	isbn = {978-94-011-4281-6},
	shorttitle = {Fluid {Flow} {Phenomena}},
	abstract = {This book deals with the simulation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for laminar and turbulent flows. The book is limited to explaining and employing the finite difference method. It furnishes a large number of source codes which permit to play with the Navier-Stokes equations and to understand the complex physics related to fluid mechanics.  Numerical simulations are useful tools to understand the complexity of the flows, which often is difficult to derive from laboratory experiments. This book, then, can be very useful to scholars doing laboratory experiments, since they often do not have extra time to study the large variety of numerical methods; furthermore they cannot spend more time in transferring one of the methods into a computer language. By means of numerical simulations, for example, insights into the vorticity field can be obtained which are difficult to obtain by measurements.  This book can be used by graduate as well as undergraduate students while reading books on theoretical fluid mechanics; it teaches how to simulate the dynamics of flow fields on personal computers. This will provide a better way of understanding the theory. Two chapters on Large Eddy Simulations have been included, since this is a methodology that in the near future will allow more universal turbulence models for practical applications. The direct simulation of the Navier-Stokes equations (DNS) is simple by finite-differences, that are satisfactory to reproduce the dynamics of turbulent flows. A large part of the book is devoted to the study of homogeneous and wall turbulent flows.  In the second chapter the elementary concept of finite difference is given to solve parabolic and elliptical partial differential equations. In successive chapters the 1D, 2D, and 3D Navier-Stokes equations are solved in Cartesian and cylindrical coordinates. Finally, Large Eddy Simulations are performed to check the importance of the subgrid scale models. Results for turbulent and laminar flows are discussed, with particular emphasis on vortex dynamics.  This volume will be of interest to graduate students and researchers wanting to compare experiments and numerical simulations, and to workers in the mechanical and aeronautic industries.},

However, at low Reynolds numbers (Rλ{\textless}50) the shape of the spectra at the Kolmogorov length scales is Reynolds number dependent. Direct simulation data from flowfields of decaying isotropic turbulence are used to compute the terms in the equation for the dissipation rate of the turbulent kinetic energy. The development of the skewness and the net destruction of the turbulence dissipation rate in the limit of low Reynolds numbers are presented. The nonlinear terms are found to remain active at surprisingly low Reynolds numbers.},

Operators based on plain aggregation algebraic multigrid provide a projective scale separation, enabling an efficient implementation of the proposed method. The application of the algebraic variational multiscale–multigrid method to turbulent flow in a channel produces results notably closer to reference (direct numerical simulation) results than other state-of-the-art methods both for mean streamwise and root-mean-square velocities. For predicting highly sensitive components of the Reynolds-stress tensor in the context of turbulent recirculating flow in a lid-driven cavity, the algebraic variational multiscale–multigrid method also shows a remarkably good performance in predicting reference results from experiment and direct numerical simulation compared to other methods.},

	abstract = {Some variants of a three-scale projection-based finite element variational multiscale (VMS) method are studied for turbulent channel flow computations at Reτ=180. Different spaces for the large scales, two eddy viscosity models and two ways of discretizing the projection terms in time are explored. The results obtained with the resolved small scales in the definition of the eddy viscosity are very sensitive to the temporal discretization of the projection terms. The computations were performed on three grids commonly used in turbulent channel flow simulations. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The unsteady Navier-Stokes equations are solved numerically at a Reynolds number of 3300, based on the mean centreline velocity and channel half-width, with about 4 × 106 grid points (192 × 129 × 160 in x, y, z). All essential turbulence scales are resolved on the computational grid and no subgrid model is used. A large number of turbulence statistics are computed and compared with the existing experimental data at comparable Reynolds numbers. Agreements as well as discrepancies are discussed in detail. Particular attention is given to the behaviour of turbulence correlations near the wall. In addition, a number of statistical correlations which are complementary to the existing experimental data are reported for the first time.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a residual-based turbulence model for the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. The method is derived employing the variational multiscale (VMS) framework. A multiscale decomposition of the continuous solution and a priori unique decomposition of the admissible spaces of functions lead to two coupled nonlinear problems termed as the coarse-scale and the fine-scale sub-problems. The fine-scale velocity field is assumed to be nonlinear and time-dependent and is modeled via the bubble functions approach applied directly to the fine-scale sub-problem. A significant contribution in this paper is a systematic and consistent derivation of the fine-scale variational operator, commonly termed as the stabilization tensor that possesses the right order in the advective and diffusive limits, and variationally projects the fine-scale solution onto the coarse-scale space. A direct treatment of the fine-scale problem via bubble functions offers several fine-scale approximation options with varying degrees of mathematical sophistication that are investigated via benchmark problems. Numerical accuracy of the proposed method is shown on a forced-isotropic turbulence problem, statistically stationary turbulent channel flow problems at ReT = 395 and 590, and non-equilibrium turbulent flow around a cylinder at Re = 3,900.},

	abstract = {Objective: In this article we study the approximation to thermal turbulence from a strictly numerical point of view, without the use of any physical model. The main goal is to analyze the behavior of our numerical method in the large eddy simulation (LES) of thermally coupled turbulent flows at low Mach number.

Methods: Our numerical method is a stabilized finite element approximation based on the variational multiscale method, in which a decomposition of the approximating space into a coarse scale resolvable part and a fine scale subgrid part is performed. Modeling the subscale and taking its effect on the coarse scale problem into account results in a stable formulation. The quality of the final approximation (accuracy, efficiency as LES model) depends on the particular subscale model. The distinctive features of our approach are to consider the subscales as transient and to keep the scale splitting in all the nonlinear terms.

Another important contribution of this work is the extension of the orthogonal subgrid scale method widely tested for incompressible flows to variable density flows, using a density-weighted L 2 product to define the orthogonality of the subscales and the finite element spaces.

Results: Referring to numerical testing, we present numerical results for a laminar testcase validation that shows the dissipative behavior of the different stabilized methods. Then, we present results of the numerical simulation of two turbulent flow problems, the turbulent channel flow with large temperature differences in the wall normal direction at Re τ = 180 , and the turbulent thermally driven cavity with aspect ratio 4. The behavior of the method is evaluated by comparison against results available in the literature obtained using LES and direct numerical simulation (DNS). They are explained based on a careful analysis of the dissipative structure of the method, showing the physical interpretation of the subgrid scale method presented.

conclusion: The material presented here is a clear indication of the potential of the method to model all kinds of turbulent thermally coupled flows. The formulation is the same in laminar and turbulent regimes.},
