	abstract = {Large Eddy Simulation is a relatively new and still evolving computatio nal strategy for predicting turbulent flows. It is now widely used in research to elucidate fundamental interactions in physics of turbulence, to predict phe nomena which are closely linked to the unsteady features of turbulence and to create data bases against which statistical closure models can be asses sed. However, its applicability to complex industrial flows, to which statisti cal models are applied routinely, has not been established with any degree of confidence. There is, in particular, a question mark against the prospect of LES becoming an economically tenable alternative to Reynolds-averaged N avier-Stokes methods at practically high Reynolds numbers and in complex geometries. Aerospace flows pose particularly challenging problems to LES, because of the high Reynolds numbers involved, the need to resolve accura tely small-scale features in the thin and often transitional boundary layers developing on aerodynamic surfaces. When the flow also contains a separated region - due to high incidence, say - the range and disparity of the influen tial scales to be resolved is enormous, and this substantially aggravates the problems of resolution and cost. It is just this combination of circumstances that has been at the heart of the project LESFOIL to which this book is devoted. The project combined the efforts, resources and expertise of 9 partner organisations, 4 universities, 3 industrial companies and 2 research institu tes.},

Boundary layer separation occurs on the upper surface at x/c=0.85. A three-component laser velocimeter, coupled with a computer-controlled data acquisition system, was used to obtain three orthogonal mean velocity components and three components of the Reynolds stress tensor in both the boundary layer and wake of the airfoil. Pressure distributions on the airfoil, skin friction distribution on the upper surface of the airfoil, and integral properties of the airfoil boudary layer are also documented. In addition to these near-field flow properties, static pressure distributions, both upstream and downstream from the airfoil and on the walls of the wind tunnel, are also presented.},

Around this Reynolds number, the flow over an airfoil separates, transits, and reattaches, resulting in the generation of a laminar separation bubble at the angle of attack in a certain degree range. Over an NACA0012 airfoil, the separation point moves toward its leading edge with an increasing angle of attack, and the separated flow may transit to create a short bubble. On the other hand, over an NACA0002 airfoil, the separation point is kept at its leading edge, and the separated flow may transit to create a long bubble. Moreover, nonlinearity appears in the lift curve of the NACA0012 airfoil, but not in that of NACA0002, despite the existence of a laminar separation bubble.},
