I would like to gratefully acknowledge the guidance, support and encouragement of my advisor, Santiago Badia. It has been a pleasure to do the Ph.D. thesis with you, Santi, and I want to thank you for your patience and for attending me all the countless times I have knocked your door.

I would also like to thank Javier Principe for his valuable advices and discussions, and also to Alberto Martín, without whom I would not have been able to meet this challenge.

I would especially like to thank Ramon Planas for his support and for acting as a mentor during the first years of my Ph.D. Also to Alba, with whom I have shared all this (long) journey. I also really appreciate the advice, help and discussions with my workmates during these years, Elisabet, Marc, Jesus, Eric, Hieu and Victor.

A special thanks to Raquel. Thank you for all the sacrifices you have done without asking anything in return, just making the things easier. I would also like to thank the support recieved from my whole family, particularly from my parents, Josep i Mercè, my brother Arnau and Carlota. Words cannot express how grateful I am to my mother, during these years you have taught me to overcome difficult situations and move forward.

Finally, I would like to acknowledge the financial support received from the Catalan Government through a FI fellowship.
