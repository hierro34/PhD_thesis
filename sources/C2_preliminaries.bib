It presents the mathematical theory of turbulence to engineers and physicists, and the physical theory of turbulence to mathematicians. The book is the result of many years of research by the authors to analyse turbulence using Sobolev spaces and functional analysis. In this way the authors have recovered parts of the conventional theory of turbulence, deriving rigorously from the Navier–Stokes equations what had been arrived at earlier by phenomenological arguments. The mathematical technicalities are kept to a minimum within the book, enabling the language to be at a level understood by a broad audience. Each chapter is accompanied by appendices giving full details of the mathematical proofs and subtleties. This unique presentation should ensure a volume of interest to mathematicians, engineers and physicists.},

	abstract = {Residual-based stabilized finite element (FE) techniques for the Navier–Stokes equations lead to numerical discretizations that provide convection stabilization as well as pressure stability without the need to satisfy an inf–sup condition. They can be motivated by using a variational multiscale (VMS) framework, based on the decomposition of the fluid velocity into a resolvable FE component plus a modelled subgrid-scale component. The subgrid closure acts as a large eddy simulation turbulence model, leading to accurate under-resolved simulations. However, even though VMS formulations are increasingly used in the applied FE community, their numerical analysis has been restricted to a priori estimates and convergence to smooth solutions only, via a priori error estimates. In this work, we prove that some versions of these methods (based on dynamic and orthogonal closures) also converge to weak (turbulent) solutions of the Navier–Stokes equations. These results are obtained by using compactness results in Bochner–Lebesgue spaces.},

Numerical simulations have proved that Variational Multiscale Methods (VMM) perform well as pure numerical large eddy simulation (LES) models. In this paper we focus on the orthogonal subgrid scale (OSS) finite element method and make an analysis of the statistical behavior of its stabilization terms in the quasi static approximation. This is done by resorting to results from classical statistical fluid mechanics concerning two point velocity, pressure and combined correlation functions of various orders. Given a fine enough mesh with characteristic element size h in the inertial subrange of a turbulent flow, it is shown that the rate of transfer of subgrid kinetic energy provided by the OSS stabilization terms does not depend on h and that it equals the molecular physical dissipation rate (up to a dimensionless constant that only depends on the finite element shapes) for a proper redesign of the standard parameters of the formulation. This is a noteworthy fact taking into account that the subgrid stabilization terms do not arise from physical considerations, but from the mathematical necessity to allow equal interpolation for the pressure and velocity fields, as well as to control convection. Therefore, the obtained results contribute somehow to the line of reasoning supporting that pure numerical approaches (i.e., without introducing additional physical models) could probably suffice in the LES simulation of turbulent flows.},

Results for the flow around a surface-mounted obstacle problem show that numerical dissipation is of the same order as the subgrid dissipation introduced by the Smagorinsky model.

Standard residual-based stabilization techniques are motivated by a multiscale approach, approximating the effect of the subscales onto the large scales. One of the approximations is to consider the subscales quasi-static (neglecting their time derivative). It is well known that these techniques are unstable for anisotropic time–space discretizations. We show that the use of dynamic subscales (where the subscales time derivatives are not neglected) solves the problem, and prove optimal convergence and stability results that are valid for anisotropic time–space discretizations.

Both can be overcome by resorting from the standard Galerkin method to a stabilized formulation. The one presented here is based on the subgrid scale concept, in which unresolvable scales of the continuous solution are approximately accounted for. In particular, the approach developed herein is based on the assumption that unresolved subscales are orthogonal to the finite element space.

For Δt fixed, the two methods are equivalent but for Δt varying they are not equivalent. Numerical experiments are described which demonstrate that the Gear-Nordsieck and BDF methods are unstable under rapidly changing Δt, but BDF is more stable. The two methods are distinguished numerically by identifying the modification of the Gear-Nordsieck method which makes it equivalent to the BDF method even if Δt changes. The computational advantage of using backward differences Δx, instead of the Nordsieck vector, for storing the backward-time information is treated by giving an operations count which shows the BDF using backward Δx's is more efficient.

	abstract = {Energy-conserving methods have recently gained popularity for the spatial discretization of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. In this paper implicit Runge–Kutta methods are investigated which keep this property when integrating in time. Firstly, a number of energy-conserving Runge–Kutta methods based on Gauss, Radau and Lobatto quadrature are constructed. These methods are suitable for convection-dominated problems (such as turbulent flows), because they do not introduce artificial diffusion and are stable for any time step. Secondly, to obtain robust time-integration methods that work also for stiff problems, the energy-conserving methods are extended to a new class of additive Runge–Kutta methods, which combine energy conservation with L-stability. In this class, the Radau IIA/B method has the best properties. Results for a number of test cases on two-stage methods indicate that for pure convection problems the additive Radau IIA/B method is competitive with the Gauss methods. However, for stiff problems, such as convection-dominated flows with thin boundary layers, both the higher order Gauss and Radau IIA/B method suffer from order reduction. Overall, the Gauss methods are the preferred method for energy-conserving time integration of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations.},

It is shown that, at least up to and including fourth order, the velocity attains the classical order of accuracy without further constraints. However, in case of a time-dependent gradient operator, which can appear in case of time-varying meshes, additional order conditions need to be satisfied to ensure the correct order of accuracy. Furthermore, the pressure is only first-order accurate unless additional order conditions are satisfied. Two new methods that lead to a second-order accurate pressure are proposed, which are applicable to a certain class of three- and four-stage methods. A special case appears when the boundary conditions for the continuity equation are independent of time, since in that case the pressure can be computed to the same accuracy as the velocity field, without additional cost. Relevant computations of decaying vortices and of an actuator disk in a time-dependent inflow support the analysis and the proposed methods.},

	abstract = {A semi-implicit three-step Runge–Kutta scheme for the unsteady incompressible Navier–Stokes equations with third-order accuracy in time is presented. The higher order of accuracy as compared to the existing semi-implicit Runge–Kutta schemes is achieved due to one additional inversion of the implicit operator I-τγL, which requires inversion of tridiagonal matrices when using approximate factorization method. No additional solution of the pressure-Poisson equation or evaluation of Navier–Stokes operator is needed. The scheme is supplied with a local error estimation and time-step control algorithm. The temporal third-order accuracy of the scheme is proved analytically and ascertained by analysing both local and global errors in a numerical example. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

There is a significant computational advantage in diagonally implicit formulae, whose coefficient matrix is lower triangular with all diagonal elements equal. We derive new, strongly S-stable diagonally implicit Runge–Kutta formulae of order 2 in 2 stages and of order 3 in 3 stages, and show that it is impossible for a strongly S-stable diagonally implicit method to attain order 4 in 4 stages. Merely A-stable diagonally implicit formulae, of order 3 in 2 stages and of order 4 in 3 stages, were previously known; we prove that no 4-stage method of this type has order 5. We describe a computer program for stiff differential equations which uses these methods, and compare them to each other and to the GEAR package.},

This paper presents a systematic study of three classes of implicit and linearly implicit time stepping schemes with adaptive time step control applied to a 2D laminar flow around a cylinder: θ -schemes, diagonal-implicit Runge–Kutta (DIRK) methods and Rosenbrock–Wanner (ROW) methods. The time step is controlled using embedded methods. It is shown that several ROW methods clearly outperform the more standard θ -schemes and the DIRK methods. The results depend on a prescribed tolerance in the time step control algorithm, whose appropriate choice varies from scheme to scheme.},

	abstract = {Numerical Methods for Ordinary Differential Systems The Initial Value Problem J. D. Lambert Professor of Numerical Analysis University of Dundee Scotland In 1973 the author published a book entitled Computational Methods in Ordinary Differential Equations. Since then, there have been many new developments in this subject and the emphasis has changed substantially. This book reflects these changes; it is intended not as a revision of the earlier work but as a complete replacement for it. Although some basic material appears in both books, the treatment given here is generally different and there is very little overlap. In 1973 there were many methods competing for attention but more recently there has been increasing emphasis on just a few classes of methods for which sophisticated implementations now exist. This book places much more emphasis on such implementations—and on the important topic of stiffness—than did its predecessor. Also included are accounts of the structure of variable-step, variable-order methods, the Butcher and the Albrecht theories for Runge—Kutta methods, order stars and nonlinear stability theory. The author has taken a middle road between analytical rigour and a purely computational approach, key results being stated as theorems but proofs being provided only where they aid the reader’s understanding of the result. Numerous exercises, from the straightforward to the demanding, are included in the text. This book will appeal to advanced students and teachers of numerical analysis and to users of numerical methods who wish to understand how algorithms for ordinary differential systems work and, on occasion, fail to work.},

	abstract = {This work is concerned with the analysis of time integration procedures for the stabilised finite element formulation of unsteady incompressible fluid flows governed by the Navier–Stokes equations. The stabilisation technique is combined with several different implicit time integration procedures including both finite difference and finite element schemes. Particular attention is given to the generalised-α method and the linear discontinuous in time finite element scheme. The time integration schemes are first applied to two model problems, represented by a first order differential equation in time and the one dimensional advection–diffusion equation, and subjected to a detailed mathematical analysis based on the Fourier series expansion. In order to establish the accuracy and efficiency of the time integration schemes for the Navier–Stokes equations, a detailed computational study is performed of two standard numerical examples: unsteady flow around a cylinder and flow across a backward facing step. It is concluded that the semi-discrete generalised-α method provides a viable alternative to the more sophisticated and expensive space–time methods for simulations of unsteady flows of incompressible fluids governed by the Navier–Stokes equations.},
