	abstract = {Direct numerical simulation ({DNS}) databases are compared to assess the accuracy and reproducibility of standard and non-standard turbulence statistics of incompressible plane channel flow at Re τ = 180. Two fundamentally different {DNS} codes are shown to produce maximum relative deviations below 0.2\% for the mean flow, below 1\% for the root-mean-square velocity and pressure fluctuations, and below 2\% for the three components of the turbulent dissipation. Relatively fine grids and long statistical averaging times are required. An analysis of dissipation spectra demonstrates that the enhanced resolution is necessary for an accurate representation of the smallest physical scales in the turbulent dissipation. The results are related to the physics of turbulent channel flow in several ways. First, the reproducibility supports the hitherto unproven theoretical hypothesis that the statistically stationary state of turbulent channel flow is unique. Second, the peaks of dissipation spectra provide information on length scales of the small-scale turbulence. Third, the computed means and fluctuations of the convective, pressure, and viscous terms in the momentum equation show the importance of the different forces in the momentum equation relative to each other. The Galilean transformation that leads to minimum peak fluctuation of the convective term is determined. Fourth, an analysis of higher-order statistics is performed. The skewness of the longitudinal derivative of the streamwise velocity is stronger than expected (−1.5 at y + = 30). This skewness and also the strong near-wall intermittency of the normal velocity are related to coherent structures.},

	abstract = {Two numerical methods were designed to solve the time-dependent, three-dimensional, incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in boundary layers (method A, semi-infinite domain) and mixing layers or wakes (method B, fully-infinite domain). Their originality lies in the use of rapidly-decaying spectral basis functions to approximate the vertical dependence of the solutions, combined with one (method A) or two (method B) slowly-decaying “extra functions” for each wave-vector that exactly represent the irrotational component of the solution at large distances. Both methods eliminate the pressure term as part of the formulation, thus avoiding fractional-step time integration. They yield rapid convergence and are free of spurious modes in the Orr-Sommerfeld spectra. They are also efficient, although the operation count is of order N2 (N is the number of modes in the infinite direction). These methods have been used for extensive direct numerical simulations of transition and turbulence. A new time-integration scheme, with low storage requirements and good stability properties, is also described.},

Existing finite difference schemes in regular and staggered grid systems are checked for violations of the conservation requirements and a few important discrepancies are pointed out. In particular, it is found that none of the existing higher order schemes for a staggered mesh system simultaneously conserve mass, momentum, and kinetic energy. This deficiency is corrected through the derivation of a general family of fully conservative higher order accurate finite difference schemes for staggered grid systems. Finite difference schemes in a collocated grid system are also analyzed, and a violation of kinetic energy conservation is revealed. The predicted conservation properties are demonstrated numerically in simulations of inviscid white noise, performed in a two-dimensional periodic domain. The proposed fourth order schemes in a staggered grid system are generalized for the case of a non-uniform mesh, and the resulting scheme is used to perform large eddy simulations of turbulent channel flow.},

	abstract = {The objective of this paper is the development and assessment of a fourth-order compact scheme for unsteady incompressible viscous flows. A brief review of the main developments of compact and high-order schemes for incompressible flows is given. A numerical method is then presented for the simulation of unsteady incompressible flows based on fourth-order compact discretization with physical boundary conditions implemented directly into the scheme. The equations are discretized on a staggered Cartesian non-uniform grid and preserve a form of kinetic energy in the inviscid limit when a skew-symmetric form of the convective terms is used. The accuracy and efficiency of the method are demonstrated in several inviscid and viscous flow problems. Results obtained with different combinations of second- and fourth-order spatial discretizations and together with either the skew-symmetric or divergence form of the convective term are compared. The performance of these schemes is further demonstrated by two challenging flow problems, linear instability in plane channel flow and a two-dimensional dipole-wall interaction. Results show that the compact scheme is efficient and that the divergence and skew-symmetric forms of the convective terms produce very similar results. In some but not all cases, a gain in accuracy and computational time is obtained with a high-order discretization of only the convective and diffusive terms. Finally, the benefits of compact schemes with respect to second-order schemes is discussed in the case of the fully developed turbulent channel flow. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The incompressibility constraint is enforced for each Runge-Kutta stage iteratively either by local pressure correction or by a Poisson-equation based global pressure correction method. Local pressure correction is carried out on cell by cell basis using a local, fourth-order accurate discrete analog of the continuity equation. The global pressure correction is based on the numerical solution of a Poisson-type equation which is discretized to fourth-order accuracy, and solved using {GMRES}. In both cases, the updated pressure is used to recompute the velocities in order to satisfy the incompressibility constraint to fourth-order accuracy.

	abstract = {Energy-conserving methods have recently gained popularity for the spatial discretization of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. In this paper implicit Runge-Kutta methods are investigated which keep this property when integrating in time. Firstly, a number of energy-conserving Runge-Kutta methods based on Gauss, Radau and Lobatto quadrature are constructed. These methods are suitable for convection-dominated problems (such as turbulent flows), because they do not introduce artificial diffusion and are stable for any time step. Secondly, to obtain robust time-integration methods that work also for stiff problems, the energy-conserving methods are extended to a new class of additive Runge-Kutta methods, which combine energy conservation with L-stability. In this class, the Radau {IIA}/B method has the best properties. Results for a number of test cases on two-stage methods indicate that for pure convection problems the additive Radau {IIA}/B method is competitive with the Gauss methods. However, for stiff problems, such as convection-dominated flows with thin boundary layers, both the higher order Gauss and Radau {IIA}/B method suffer from order reduction. Overall, the Gauss methods are the preferred method for energy-conserving time integration of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.},

Mimicking crucial properties of differential operators forms in itself a motivation for discretizing them in a certain manner. We give it a concrete form by noting that a symmetry-preserving discretization of the Navier-Stokes equations is stable on any grid, and conserves the total mass, momentum and kinetic energy (for the latter the physical dissipation is to be turned off, of coarse). Being stable on any grid, the choice of the grid may be based on the required accuracy solely, and the main question becomes: how accurate is a symmetry-preserving discretization? Its accuracy is tested for a turbulent flow in a channel by comparing the results to those of physical experiments and previous numerical studies. The comparison is carried out for a Reynolds number of 5600, which is based on the channel width and the mean bulk velocity (based on the channel half-width and wall shear velocity the Reynolds number becomes 180). The comparison shows that with a fourth-order, symmetry-preserving method a 64×64×32 grid suffices to perform an accurate numerical simulation.},

Thus, for high-order simulations of underresolved turbulence, proper stabilization is necessary for a successful computation. Two different mechanisms are chosen, and their impact on the accuracy of underresolved high-order computations of turbulent flows is investigated. Results of these approximations for the Taylor-Green Vortex problem are compared to direct numerical simulation results from literature.

	abstract = {The adaptive local deconvolution method ({ALDM}) is proposed as a new nonlinear discretization scheme designed for implicit large-eddy simulation ({ILES}) of turbulent flows. In {ILES} the truncation error of the discretization of the convective terms functions as a subgrid-scale model. Therefore, the model is implicitly contained within the discretization, and an explicit computation of model terms becomes unnecessary. The discretization is based on a solution-adaptive deconvolution operator which allows to control the truncation error. Deconvolution parameters are determined by an analysis of the spectral numerical viscosity. An automatic optimization based on an evolutionary algorithm is employed to obtain a set of parameters which results in an optimum spectral match for the numerical viscosity with theoretical predictions for isotropic turbulence. Simulations of large-scale forced and decaying three-dimensional homogeneous isotropic turbulence show an excellent agreement with theory and experimental data and demonstrate the good performance of the implicit model. As an example for transitional flows, instability and breakdown of the three-dimensional Taylor-Green vortex are considered. The implicit model correctly predicts instability growth and transition to developed turbulence. It is shown that the implicit model performs at least as well as established explicit models.},

Typical strategies are based on the combination of the solutions computed either with two different time steps or two schemes with different accuracy. In this paper, we move from the pressure correction algebraic factorizations formerly proposed by Saleri, Veneziani (2005). These schemes feature an intrinsic hierarchical nature, such that an accurate solution for the pressure is obtained by computing intermediate low-order guesses. The difference between the two estimates provide a natural a posteriori estimator. After introducing the incremental formulation of the pressure correction schemes, we address the properties of this approach, including extensive implementation details. Numerical results presented refer to 2D and 3D unstructured problems, with a particular emphasis on cardiovascular problems, which are expected to largely benefit from time-adaptive solvers.

However, in case of a time-dependent gradient operator, which can appear in case of time-varying meshes, additional order conditions need to be satisfied to ensure the correct order of accuracy. Furthermore, the pressure is only first-order accurate unless additional order conditions are satisfied. Two new methods that lead to a second-order accurate pressure are proposed, which are applicable to a certain class of three- and four-stage methods. A special case appears when the boundary conditions for the continuity equation are independent of time, since in that case the pressure can be computed to the same accuracy as the velocity field, without additional cost. Relevant computations of decaying vortices and of an actuator disk in a time-dependent inflow support the analysis and the proposed methods.},

This linear solution scheme can significantly reduce the computational costs in terms of computer {CPU} time and memory requirements without the sacrifice of the solution accuracy if the time-step size is sufficiently small. Furthermore, the possibility of adaptively adjusting time-step size is fully exploited. By choosing the volume loss rate as an error indicator, a simple adaptive time-stepping scheme is presented.

Higher order schemes, based on improved factorizations, are also introduced. We have also explained the relationship between these pressure segregation methods and some widely used preconditioners, and we have introduced predictor-corrector methods, one-loop algorithms where nonlinearity and iterations towards the monolithic system are coupled.},

The error committed in the discretization method primarily depends on the time-step size h, which is varied along the solution in order to minimize the computational effort subject to a prescribed accuracy requirement. This paper reviews the recent advances in developing local adaptivity algorithms based on well established techniques from linear feedback control theory, which is introduced in a numerical context. Replacing earlier heuristics, this systematic approach results in a more consistent and robust performance. The dynamic behaviour of the discretization method together with the controller is analyzed. We also review some basic techniques for the coordination of nonlinear equation solvers with the primary stepsize controller in implicit time-stepping methods.},

	abstract = {For implicit Runge-Kutta methods intended for stiff {ODEs} or {DAEs}, it is often difficult to embed a local error estimating method which gives realistic error estimates for stiff/algebraic components. If the embedded method's stability function is unbounded at z=∞, stiff error components are grossly overestimated. In practice, some codes ‘improve’ such inadequate error estimates by premultiplying the estimate by a ‘filter’ matrix which damps or removes the large, stiff error components. Although improving computational performance, this technique is somewhat arbitrary and lacks a sound theoretical backing. In this scientific note we resolve this problem by introducing an implicit error estimator. It has the desired properties for stiff/algebraic components without invoking artificial improvements. The error estimator contains a free parameter which determines the magnitude of the error, and we show how this parameter is to be selected on the basis of method properties. The construction principles for the error estimator can be adapted to all implicit Runge-Kutta methods, and a better agreement between actual and estimated errors is achieved, resulting in better performance.},

The major focus is on the differences in accuracy and efficiency between the backward Euler, Crank-Nicolson and fractional-step Θ schemes used in discretizing the momentum equations. Further, the differences between fully coupled solvers and operator-splitting techniques (projection methods) and the influence of the treatment of the nonlinear advection term are considered. The combination of both discrete projection schemesand non-conforming finite elementsallows the comparison of schemes which are representative for many methods used in practice. On Cartesian grids this approach encompasses some well-known staggered grid finite difference discretizations too. The results which are obtained for several typical flow problems are thought to be representative and should be helpful for a fair rating of solution schemes, particularly in long-time simulations.},

We prove that, under certain conditions, the order in time of the fully discrete scheme equals the conventional order of the Runge-Kutta formula being used. However, these conditions, which are necessary for the result to hold, are not natural. As a result, in many problems the order in time will be strictly smaller than the conventional one, a phenomenon called order reduction. This phenomenon is extensively discussed, both analytically and numerically. As distinct from earlier contributions we here treat explicit Runge-Kutta schemes. Although our results are valid for both parabolic and hyperbolic problems, the examples we present are therefore taken from the hyperbolic field, as it is in this area that explicit discretizations are most appealing.},
