	abstract = {Abstract
Numerical simulations have proved that Variational Multiscale Methods (VMM) perform well as pure numerical large eddy simulation (LES) models. In this paper we focus on the orthogonal subgrid scale (OSS) finite element method and make an analysis of the statistical behavior of its stabilization terms in the quasi static approximation. This is done by resorting to results from classical statistical fluid mechanics concerning two point velocity, pressure and combined correlation functions of various orders. Given a fine enough mesh with characteristic element size h in the inertial subrange of a turbulent flow, it is shown that the rate of transfer of subgrid kinetic energy provided by the OSS stabilization terms does not depend on h and that it equals the molecular physical dissipation rate (up to a dimensionless constant that only depends on the finite element shapes) for a proper redesign of the standard parameters of the formulation. This is a noteworthy fact taking into account that the subgrid stabilization terms do not arise from physical considerations, but from the mathematical necessity to allow equal interpolation for the pressure and velocity fields, as well as to control convection. Therefore, the obtained results contribute somehow to the line of reasoning supporting that pure numerical approaches (i.e., without introducing additional physical models) could probably suffice in the LES simulation of turbulent flows.},

	abstract = {In turbulence applications, strongly imposed no-slip conditions often lead to inaccurate mean flow quantities for coarse boundary-layer meshes. To circumvent this shortcoming, weakly imposed Dirichlet boundary conditions for fluid dynamics were recently introduced in [Y. Bazilevs, T.J.R. Hughes, Weak imposition of Dirichlet boundary conditions in fluid mechanics, Comput. Fluids 36 (2007) 12–26]. In the present work, we propose a modification of the original weak boundary condition formulation that consistently incorporates the well-known “law of the wall”. To compare the different methods, we conduct numerical experiments for turbulent channel flow at Reynolds number 395 and 950. In the limit of vanishing mesh size in the wall-normal direction, the weak boundary condition acts like a strong boundary condition. Accordingly, strong and weak boundary conditions give essentially identical results on meshes that are stretched to better capture boundary layers. However, on uniform meshes that are incapable of resolving boundary layers, weakly imposed boundary conditions deliver significantly more accurate mean flow quantities than their strong counterparts. Hence, weakly imposed boundary conditions present a robust technique for flows of industrial interest, where optimal mesh design is usually not feasible and resolving boundary layers is prohibitively expensive. Our numerical results show that the formulation that incorporates the law of the wall yields an improvement over the original method.},

The convergence of the mean velocity profile for a turbulent channel flow suggests that weak no-slip conditions behave very much like a wall function model, although the design of the boundary condition is based purely on numerical, rather than physical or empirical, conditions.},

We treat the nonlinear terms arising in the variational formulation of the problem with a semi-implicit approach leading to a linear system associated to the fully discrete problem which needs to be assembled and solved only once at each discrete time instance. We solve this linear system by means of the GMRES method by employing a multigrid (ML) right preconditioner for the parallel setting. We validate the proposed fully discrete scheme towards the benchmark problem of the flow past a squared cylinder at high Reynolds number and we show the computational efficiency and scalability results of the solver in a High Performance Computing framework.},

Not all the author's opinions will be accepted, but his hope is to stimulate reflection, discussion, and planning. These levels still range from a solution of the steady Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations to a Direct Numerical Simulation, with Large-Eddy Simulation in between. However recent years have added intermediate strategies, dubbed “VLES”, “URANS” and “DES”. They are in experimental use and, although more expensive, threaten complex RANS models especially for bluff-body and similar flows. Turbulence predictions in aerodynamics face two principal challenges: (I) growth and separation of the boundary layer, and (II) momentum transfer after separation. (I) is simpler, but makes very high accuracy demands, and appears to give models of higher complexity little advantage. (II) is now the arena for complex RANS models and the newer strategies, by which time-dependent three-dimensional simulations are the norm even over two-dimensional geometries. In some strategies, grid refinement is aimed at numerical accuracy; in others it is aimed at richer turbulence physics. In some approaches, the empirical constants play a strong role even when the grid is very fine; in others, their role vanishes. For several decades, practical methods will necessarily be RANS, possibly unsteady, or RANS/LES hybrids, pure LES being unaffordable. Their empirical content will remain substantial, and the law of the wall will be particularly resistant. Estimates are offered of the grid resolution needed for the application of each strategy to full-blown aerodynamic calculations, feeding into rough estimates of its feasibility date, based on computing-power growth.},
